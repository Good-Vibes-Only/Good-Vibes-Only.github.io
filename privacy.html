									<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

                  <h3>Information you share with us</h3>
									<p>In order to use Good Vibes, you must sign up with a valid email address. You must have an account in order to upload, share, or interact with content on Good Vibes. When you choose to share the information below with us, we collect and use it to operate our services.</p>

									<h3>Account Information</h3>
									<p>If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Good Vibes this includes a display name (for example, “John Doe”), a username (for example, @JohnDoe), a password, an email address, and phone number. Your display name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can also create and manage multiple accounts, for example to express different parts of your identity.</p>

                  <h3>Public Information</h3>
									<p>Most activity on Good Vibes is public, including your profile information, your posts, and posts you have vibed with. The people you follow and who follow you are also public. If you like, vibe, reply, or otherwise publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about you associated with the ad with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach. Information posted about you by other people who use our services may also be public.

You are responsible for your Posts and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Good Vibes, such as by deleting a Post or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on our mobile apps.
</p>
                  <h3>Contact Information and Address Books</h3>
									<p>We use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to authenticate your account and keep it - and our services - secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. We also use contact information to enable certain account features and to send you information about our services, and to personalize our services, including ads. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from Good Vibes to that number as your country’s laws allow. Good Vibes also uses your contact information to market to you as your country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications. You can use your settings for mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from Good Vibes.

You can choose to upload and sync your address book on Good Vibes so that we can help you find and connect with people you know and help others find and connect with you. We also use this information to better recommend content to you and others.

If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to your request.
</p>
                  <h3>Non-Public Communication</h3>
									<p>We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example, you can use make your account private in order to hide your content from people that do not follow you. Even if your post is private, we store the information from that post and keep a copy even if it is deleted (see our Terms and Conditions).</p>

									<h3>Controlling the Information you Share with us</h3>
									<p>Through the Privacy and Safety page under Settings you can:
-	Make your account private (and subsequently making your posts private)
-	Control who is allowed to follow you through a request system
-	Control what aspects of Good Vibes you receive notifications from
-	Whether you upload your address book to Good Vibes for storage and use
</p>
                  <h3>Information We Share and Disclose</h3>
									<p>We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. If you’ve shared information like private Posts with someone else who accesses Good Vibes through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.
Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services. For example, we share with advertisers the identifiers of devices that saw their ads, to enable them to measure the effectiveness of our advertising business. Information we share with these partners does not include your name, email address, phone number, or Twitter username, but some of these partnerships allow the information we share to be linked to other personal information if the partner gets your consent first.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve, use, or disclose your personal data or other safety data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services, or to explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your personal data.

We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of times people engaged with a Post, demographics, the number of people who clicked on a particular link, some inferred interests, or reports to advertisers about how many people saw or clicked on their ads.
</p>

									<p>Our services are not directed to children, and you may not use our services if you are under the age of 13.

</p>

                  <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
									<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our processing of your personal data and will always be at LINK. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via a Good Vibes update (push notification) or email to the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to be bound by this updated Privacy Policy, stop using good vibes immediately, or deactivate your account.
